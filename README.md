# cmdcode2api

[中文说明](README.zh-CN.md)

`cmdcode2api` is a small OpenAI-compatible gateway for [Command Code](https://commandcode.ai/). OpenAI-style clients call the familiar `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/models` endpoints, and the gateway forwards requests to Command Code — rotating across multiple accounts, tracking usage, and serving a built-in admin WebUI.

## Features

- OpenAI-compatible `POST /v1/chat/completions` (streaming and non-streaming) and `GET /v1/models`
- Multiple Command Code accounts with round-robin rotation and automatic failover (`401`/`403`/`429`/5xx), including per-account 429 cooldown
- Multiple local client API keys with per-key request and token accounting
- Command Code quota dashboard: 5-hour / weekly / estimated monthly progress bars, credit balances, plan and billing period, refreshed in the background every 5 minutes
- Embedded single-file WebUI: usage dashboard, account/key management, model exposure editor, live settings, and log tail
- Browser OAuth helper for obtaining a Command Code API key (CLI or WebUI); each OAuth run adds an account
- Local bearer-token auth for clients, separate admin password for the WebUI
- Usage counters (global, per-account, per-client-key) and cached quota snapshots persisted to `usage.json`
- Base64 `image_url` conversion to Command Code image blocks; CORS enabled for local UI clients
- `GET /health` and `GET /usage` endpoints

## Quick start

```bash
go build -o cmdcode2api ./cmd/cmdcode2api
./cmdcode2api
```

The first start writes `config.yaml` in the working directory and prints the generated client key and WebUI admin password once. Add a Command Code account (next section), then point any OpenAI client at the gateway:

```bash
curl http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <local-api-key>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "model": "deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash",
    "messages": [
      {"role": "user", "content": "Hello"}
    ],
    "stream": false
  }'
```

The server starts fine with zero accounts — the WebUI, client keys, and settings all work, and chat requests return `503 no_accounts` until one is added. Adding the first account from the WebUI fetches the model catalog immediately.

## Docker

Prebuilt multi-arch images are published to GHCR by CI on every master push (`latest`) and every `v*` tag. `config.yaml` and `usage.json` live in the `/data` volume:

```bash
docker run -d --name cmdcode2api -p 11434:11434 -v cmdcode2api-data:/data ghcr.io/peach0x33a/cmdcode2api:latest
```

A ready-to-copy Compose file is provided as `docker-compose.example.yml`:

```bash
cp docker-compose.example.yml docker-compose.yml
docker compose up -d
```

With an empty data directory the first start generates `config.yaml`, prints the client key and admin password once (`docker compose logs`), and then serves. To build the image locally, use `docker build -t cmdcode2api .` — networks that cannot reach proxy.golang.org can pass `--build-arg GOPROXY=https://goproxy.cn,direct`.

## Adding Command Code accounts

### WebUI (simplest)

Open `/webui`, go to the **Accounts** tab, and paste a Command Code API key. This works regardless of container networking or SSH access.

The Accounts tab can also run the OAuth flow. By default it uses the server's local `127.0.0.1:5959-5968` callback ports, which works out of the box when the browser runs on the same machine. For remote or containerized deployments, fill in the **callback URL** field with an address the browser can reach — the gateway's own `http://<server>:11434/admin/api/oauth/callback` is the usual choice. The Command Code page then posts the credential there; the transfer is protected by a single-use state token.

### CLI OAuth

```bash
./cmdcode2api --oauth
```

The OAuth callback server always binds to `127.0.0.1:5959-5968` on the machine running the binary. Each successful flow appends one account to `config.yaml`; run `--oauth` again (e.g. with a different browser profile) to add more accounts, and re-authorizing an existing key is a no-op.

**Browser on the same machine** — open the printed authorization URL directly.

**Browser on a different machine** — forward a callback port over SSH and pass an explicit callback URL:

```bash
# local machine
ssh -L 5959:127.0.0.1:5959 user@server

# server
./cmdcode2api --oauth --oauth-callback http://localhost:5959/callback
```

### Inside a container

The callback server listens on `127.0.0.1:5959-5968` *inside the container*, so the browser must be able to reach that port in the container's network namespace:

```bash
# browser on the same machine: share the host network
docker compose run --rm --network host cmdcode2api --oauth

# browser on a different machine: forward the port over SSH first
ssh -L 5959:127.0.0.1:5959 user@server
docker compose run --rm --network host cmdcode2api --oauth \
  --oauth-callback http://localhost:5959/callback

# without Compose
docker run --rm -it --network host -v cmdcode2api-data:/data \
  ghcr.io/peach0x33a/cmdcode2api:latest --oauth
```

After authorizing, the account is appended to `/data/config.yaml` automatically; run `docker compose up -d` afterwards if the gateway is still stopped.

## Command-line flags

| Flag | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `--oauth` | Run the browser OAuth flow to obtain a Command Code API key |
| `--oauth-callback URL` | Explicit callback URL for `--oauth`, e.g. `http://localhost:5959/callback` |
| `--host HOST` | HTTP listen host override, e.g. `0.0.0.0` |
| `--port PORT` | HTTP listen port override |
| `--debug` | Print request bodies and all upstream SSE events to stderr |
| `--version` | Print the version and Go runtime version, then exit |

## Configuration

`config.yaml` lives in the working directory, is created automatically, and is ignored by git. Example shape:

```yaml
api_key: ccgw-generated-local-client-key
api_keys:
  - name: default
    key: ccgw-generated-local-client-key
  - name: my-agent
    key: ccgw-another-client-key
admin_password: kR7vBn2xQm9T
webui: true
commandcode:
  base_url: https://api.commandcode.ai
  accounts:
    - name: main
      api_key: your-command-code-api-key
      enabled: true
    - name: backup
      api_key: another-command-code-api-key
host: localhost
port: 11434
exclude_models:
  - gpt-
  - claude-
  - gemini-
```

Fields:

- `api_key` — legacy single local client key. Migrated into `api_keys` on load and cleared on save once the list is non-empty.
- `api_keys` — local bearer keys that clients use to call this gateway. Requests and token usage are tracked per key. Manage them in the WebUI; changes apply immediately and persist here.
- `admin_password` — password for the WebUI admin API. Generated on first start when empty and printed once.
- `webui` — set to `false` to disable serving the embedded WebUI and admin API entirely.
- `commandcode.accounts` — list of Command Code credentials. Requests rotate across enabled accounts (see below). The legacy single-key field `commandcode.api_key` is still accepted and migrated to a one-entry list on load.
- `commandcode.base_url` — Command Code API base URL.
- `host` — HTTP listen host. Defaults to `localhost`; use `0.0.0.0` to listen on all interfaces.
- `port` — HTTP listen port. Defaults to `11434`.
- `exclude_models` — model ID prefixes hidden from `/v1/models` and rejected by `/v1/chat/completions`. Maintained from the WebUI's Models tab, where the upstream catalog is shown with checkboxes.

New configs exclude `gpt-`, `claude-`, and `gemini-` by default. These prefixes match both plain model IDs such as `gpt-4` and provider-qualified IDs such as `openai/gpt-4` by checking the part after the final `/`. To make all models available, remove the entries or set `exclude_models: []`.

## Multi-account rotation

Every chat request is sent with the next enabled account in round-robin order. When an account fails with `401`, `403`, `429`, or a 5xx, the request is retried with the next account automatically:

- A `429` puts the account into cooldown for the upstream `Retry-After` duration (60 seconds by default); cooldown accounts are skipped until they recover. If every enabled account is cooling down, the client receives `429 rate_limit_error` with the earliest recovery time.
- `400`/`422` (bad request) and client-canceled contexts are not retried.
- Failover happens before any bytes are sent to the client; once a stream has started it is never replayed on another account.
- Per-account request/token counters persist in `usage.json`; error state, last error, and cooldown windows are runtime-only and visible in the WebUI.

## Client keys

`api_keys` holds the bearer keys clients use to call this gateway; different clients can each use their own key:

- Create keys in the WebUI's **Keys** tab — values are always server-generated (`ccgw-` prefix) and never accepted from input; keys can be enabled/disabled, copied, and deleted.
- Each key gets independent request and token counters, persisted in `usage.json` under `client_keys` and visible at `/usage`.
- Keys are masked in the list; reveal or copy them on demand — the full value is shown once at creation and available via the reveal endpoint.
- The legacy single `api_key` field keeps working and migrates to one key named `default` on load.

## WebUI

With `webui` enabled (the default), the binary serves an embedded single-file admin interface under `/webui` (the root path stays free for the API):

```text
http://localhost:11434/webui
```

Log in with the server address and `admin_password`. The same `internal/web/index.html` can also be opened directly in a browser and pointed at any running instance.

Tabs:

- **Overview** — version, uptime, listen address, usage counters, account/key/model summaries, and a quota sync summary (synced / exceeded / low-balance accounts, last refresh)
- **Accounts** — add (paste a key or run OAuth with an optional callback URL), edit name/key, enable/disable, connectivity test, quota refresh, delete; per-account requests, tokens, errors, cooldown state, last error, and quota. OAuth-added accounts are named after the Command Code user automatically
- **Models** — checkbox list of upstream models; checked = exposed via `/v1/models` and callable, unchecked = hidden. This is the editor for `exclude_models` and applies live
- **Keys** — create local client API keys, enable/disable, copy, delete; per-key usage (see [Client keys](#client-keys))
- **Settings** — edit `base_url` (live), `host`/`port`/`webui` (persisted, applied on restart), and change the admin password (requires the current password; every existing admin session is kicked afterwards)
- **Logs** — tail of the in-memory log ring (last 500 lines)

Changes to accounts and settings are written back to `config.yaml` immediately — no restart needed.

Security notes: admin authentication is rate limited per source IP (5 failed attempts in 10 minutes locks the source out for 15 minutes), responses carry hardening headers (CSP, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`, `nosniff`, `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer`) and are never cached, and the login form supports password managers (Bitwarden et al.). "Remember password" keeps the credential in `localStorage`; unchecked, it lives in `sessionStorage` and dies with the tab.

### Quota dashboard

The Accounts tab shows each account's Command Code quota, read with the same API key from the undocumented `/alpha/*` endpoints (`whoami`, `billing/credits`, `billing/subscriptions`, `usage/summary`):

- **5-hour** and **weekly** bars come straight from the upstream `windowLimits` objects. Bars grade amber at ≥50% used, heavier amber at ≥75%, and red at ≥90%.
- **Monthly** is *derived*: the API exposes no monthly window, so the cap comes from the community CLI's plan mapping (`individual-pro` → 30, `individual-pro-v1` → 80, …), with `used = cap − remaining credits`. It is labelled as estimated; unknown plans fall back to balance-only display.
- Credit balances (monthly remaining / purchased / free), plan name and status, billing-period end, and billing-period totals.
- A per-account **refresh quota** button and a **refresh all** button (which returns immediately and refreshes in the background).

Quota refresh runs once shortly after startup and every 5 minutes afterwards; the latest snapshot is cached in `usage.json` so it survives restarts. A failed query keeps the last successful snapshot and only records the error and check time. These endpoints come from [commandcode-usage](https://github.com/MAXeaglet/commandcode-usage); they are unofficial, so the parser tolerates field drift (camelCase or snake_case, epoch seconds / milliseconds / ISO timestamps, flat or `data`-wrapped responses).

### Admin API

The UI talks to a JSON API under `/admin/api/*`, authenticated with `Authorization: Bearer <admin_password>` (works for scripts and curl too):

```text
GET    /admin/api/overview
GET    /admin/api/accounts
POST   /admin/api/accounts             {"name": "...", "api_key": "..."}
PATCH  /admin/api/accounts/{id}        {"enabled": true}, {"name": "..."} or {"api_key": "..."}
DELETE /admin/api/accounts/{id}
POST   /admin/api/accounts/{id}/test
POST   /admin/api/accounts/{id}/quota/refresh
POST   /admin/api/quotas/refresh       202 + background refresh of every account; with {"id": "..."} it refreshes one account synchronously
GET    /admin/api/models
PUT    /admin/api/models               {"exposed": ["model-id", ...]}
GET    /admin/api/keys
POST   /admin/api/keys                 {"name": "..."} — the key value is always server-generated
GET    /admin/api/keys/{id}/reveal
PATCH  /admin/api/keys/{id}            {"enabled": true} or {"name": "..."}
DELETE /admin/api/keys/{id}
GET    /admin/api/settings
PUT    /admin/api/settings
GET    /admin/api/logs?after=SEQ
POST   /admin/api/oauth/start
GET    /admin/api/oauth/status
POST   /admin/api/oauth/cancel
```

`GET /admin/api/accounts` includes a nested `quota` object per account; `GET /admin/api/overview` includes a `quotas` summary (`synced`, `exceeded`, `low_balance`, `last_checked_at`).

## HTTP API

### `GET /health`

No authentication required.

```json
{"status":"ok"}
```

### `GET /usage`

No authentication required. Returns locally accumulated usage counters plus per-account and per-client-key breakdowns:

```json
{
  "total_requests": 1,
  "prompt_tokens": 7527,
  "completion_tokens": 55,
  "cache_read_tokens": 7424,
  "cache_write_tokens": 0,
  "accounts": {
    "a1b2c3d4": {"requests": 1, "prompt_tokens": 7527, "completion_tokens": 55, "cache_read_tokens": 7424, "cache_write_tokens": 0}
  },
  "client_keys": {
    "k9f8e7d6c": {"requests": 1, "prompt_tokens": 7527, "completion_tokens": 55, "cache_read_tokens": 7424, "cache_write_tokens": 0}
  }
}
```

Usage is persisted to `usage.json`, which is ignored by git. Cached quota snapshots also live in that file but are never exposed here.

### `GET /v1/models`

Returns the model list after applying `exclude_models` filtering, so excluded models do not appear. Each entry carries a `context_window` field when the upstream reports one.

### `POST /v1/chat/completions`

Accepts OpenAI-style chat completion requests and forwards them to Command Code. Requests for excluded models return `404` with an OpenAI-compatible error JSON shape.

**Model IDs** must match `/v1/models` output exactly, including the provider prefix:

```text
deepseek/deepseek-v4-flash          ✓
deepseek-v4-flash                   ✗ missing provider prefix
deepseek-ai/deepseek-v4-flash       ✗ wrong provider prefix
```

**Supported request styles:** plain text messages, multimodal content arrays, `stream: true` server-sent events, and `stream: false` JSON responses.

**Images:** multimodal `image_url` values must be base64 `data:image/...;base64,...` URLs. Remote HTTP(S) image URLs are rejected with `400 invalid_request_error` — the gateway never downloads remote images.

Upstream `inputTokenDetails.cacheReadTokens` is exposed in the response as `usage.prompt_tokens_details.cached_tokens`. `cacheWriteTokens` is available in `/usage` but not in the Chat Completions response, because OpenAI's standard usage schema has no cache-write field.

## Running behind nginx

If nginx and cmdcode2api run on the same host, keep forwarding Cloudflare's `CF-Connecting-IP` and `X-Forwarded-For` headers. The server accepts these headers only from loopback proxy connections, then uses the resolved address for HTTP logs and admin login rate limiting. Direct connections with forged proxy headers continue to use their TCP peer address.

For `X-Forwarded-For`, only the rightmost entry (the one an appending proxy wrote) is honored: leftmost entries are client-controlled, and a client forging a fresh one per request would rotate its rate-limit key. Do not preserve the client-supplied header via `proxy_add_x_forwarded_for`, and prefer allowing only Cloudflare's published proxy CIDRs at the nginx level so `CF-Connecting-IP` cannot be forged by connecting to the origin directly. If nginx itself also needs `$remote_addr` to represent the end user, configure `real_ip_header CF-Connecting-IP` with Cloudflare's published proxy CIDRs.

Client Bearer Tokens are any key from the `api_keys` list in `config.yaml`.

## Notes

This is a personal utility gateway and currently targets the Command Code API shape observed during development. If Command Code changes its internal API, the adapter may need updates. The project was originally named `cc-gateway` and was renamed to avoid confusion with Claude Code's common `cc` abbreviation.
